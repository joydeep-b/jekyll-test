Our web-based IDE for *JavaScript without the "bad parts"* is now live: [www.ocelot-ide.org](https://www.ocelot-ide.org/).  
[Sam Lee]() was the lead developer on the project, working with [Arjun Guha](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~arjun/main/home/) and me. We use Ocelot to teach COMPSCI 220 (Programming
Methodology) at UMass (see my [teaching](/teaching.html) page).

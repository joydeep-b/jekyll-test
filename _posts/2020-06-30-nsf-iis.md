Our proposal titled "Introspective Perception and Planning for Long-Term Autonomy", with
collaborator [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/) was
awarded by the NSF! This project aims to develop new algorithms and mathematical
formulations to allow robots to autonomously discover unforseen limitations in
their perception and planning during deployments in novel environments, and to
leverage repair patterns to overcome such limitations over time.

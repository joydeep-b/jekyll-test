Positions are for a one-year term, with the possibility of renewal for additional years. The position would be in the Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory headed by Prof. Joydeep Biswas.

POSITION: Post-doctoral fellow on Perception and Planning for Long-Term Autonomous Mobile Robots

SUPERVISOR: Prof. Joydeep Biswas

LOCATION:  
Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory  
Department of Computer Science  
University of Texas at Austin


DESCRIPTION:   
The Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory at UT Austin is hiring a postdoctoral fellow to conduct research on perception and planning for long-term autonomy of mobile robots. Research topic areas of interest include long-term mapping, fusing learning-based and geometric approaches to state estimation, multi-robot planning, social navigation, competency-aware perception and planning, and failure detection and recovery.

UTCS and Texas Robotics is a deeply collaborative environment, and the postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity and be expected to collaborate with researchers from other labs.

Additionally, the postdoctoral fellow will be welcome to co-teach robotics courses, including an undergraduate-level hands-on robotics course taught with a fleet of scale 1/10 autonomous cars, or a graduate robotics course.

APPLICATION DETAILS: 
Please submit 1) a CV, 2) a brief description of research interests, 3) two relevant past publications, 4) a list of two references (with email addresses), and 5) an optional link to relevant code samples such as a GitHub repository or open-source ROS packages, via email to [joydeepb@cs.utexas.edu](mailto:joydeepb@cs.utexas.edu)

TIMELINE: 
The position is open immediately, and will remain open until filled. The option for a deferred start date to complete an existing appointment or doctoral thesis is available.

My PhD thesis at Carnegie Mellon University was on robust and accurate long-term
mobile robot localization in varying environments. We had multiple CoBots
deployed in our buildings, which covered 1000 km over deployments to demonstrate
the reliability and robustness of the localization algorithms 
introduced in the thesis, in particular Episodic non-Markov Localization.
